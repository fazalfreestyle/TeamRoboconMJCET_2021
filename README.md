# TEAM ROBOCON MJCET-2021



The theme was "Arrow Game" by China. Two robots were made both semi-autonomous. Throwing Robot a.k.a. TR goes to the arrow rack picks up the arrows and throws them into the pots. Whereas, Defensive Robot a.k.a DR interrupts the arrows thrown by opponent TR. The most arrows thrown into the pots win.

**Specifications of Passing robot(PR): -**
* Operating Voltage: 24V
* The Locomotion is achieved by interfacing the PS2 Controller joystick with the microcontroller.
* The MicroController is mounted onto the PCB (designed using Cadsoft EAGLE).
* For the steering mechanism was controlled with only one motor for all the four wheels and the driving mechnism was controlled by a wheel attached to a motor. 
* Rotary encoders are used as feedback from the motors for improved precision for passing and kicking.
* For passing mechanism, the claw was actuated by a pneumatic piston and the ball was throwed.
* For kicking mechanism, the rod simply rotates and hit it the ball.


**Specifications of Try Robot(TR): -**
* Operating Voltage: 24V
* The Locomotion is achieved by interfacing the PS2 Controller joystick with the microcontroller.
* The MicroController is mounted onto the PCB (designed using Cadsoft EAGLE).
* For the steering mechanism was controlled with only one motor for all the four wheels and the driving mechnism was controlled by a wheel attached to a motor. 
* The servo motor attached with a string that opens the vent which release the ball on the Try spot.
